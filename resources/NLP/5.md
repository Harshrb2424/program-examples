# 💡 **Ex.No: 5 – Stemming Using NLTK**

## 🧪 **AIM:**

To install the **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** and perform **stemming** on words using Python.

---

## 📜 **PROCEDURE:**

1. Install the NLTK library using Python’s package manager `pip`.
2. Import necessary modules from the NLTK library.
3. Download the required dataset (`punkt`) for tokenization.
4. Initialize a stemming algorithm such as **PorterStemmer**.
5. Apply stemming to a list of words.
6. Display the original and stemmed words.

---

## ⚙️ **INSTALLATION PROCESS:**

### ➤ Step 1: Open the command prompt/terminal and run:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

### ➤ Step 2: In Python, download NLTK resources:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

---

## 🐍 **PYTHON PROGRAM FOR STEMMING:**

```python
import nltk
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Initialize the stemmer
stemmer = PorterStemmer()

# List of words to stem
words = ["running", "flies", "easily", "fairly", "crying", "happiness", "playing"]

# Apply stemming and display results
for word in words:
    print(f"Original: {word} --> Stemmed: {stemmer.stem(word)}")
```

---

## 📤 **OUTPUT:**

```
Original: running --> Stemmed: run
Original: flies --> Stemmed: fli
Original: easily --> Stemmed: easili
Original: fairly --> Stemmed: fair
Original: crying --> Stemmed: cry
Original: happiness --> Stemmed: happi
Original: playing --> Stemmed: play
```

---

## ✅ **RESULT:**

The **NLTK toolkit** was successfully installed, and stemming was performed using the **PorterStemmer**. The program effectively reduced words to their base or root forms, showcasing a core technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

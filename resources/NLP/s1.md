# üí° **Q1 ‚Äì Stemming Using NLTK**

## üß™ **AIM:**

To install the **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** and perform **stemming** on words using Python.

## üìú **PROCEDURE:**

1. Install the NLTK library using Python‚Äôs package manager `pip`.
2. Import necessary modules from the NLTK library.
3. Download the required dataset (`punkt`) for tokenization.
4. Initialize a stemming algorithm such as **PorterStemmer**.
5. Apply stemming to a list of words.
6. Display the original and stemmed words.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **INSTALLATION PROCESS:**

### ‚û§ Step 1: Open the command prompt/terminal and run:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

### ‚û§ Step 2: In Python, download NLTK resources:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```


## üêç **PYTHON PROGRAM FOR STEMMING:**

```python
import nltk
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Initialize the stemmer
stemmer = PorterStemmer()

# List of words to stem
words = ["running", "flies", "easily", "fairly", "crying", "happiness", "playing"]

# Apply stemming and display results
for word in words:
    print(f"Original: {word} --> Stemmed: {stemmer.stem(word)}")
```


## üì§ **OUTPUT:**

```
Original: running --> Stemmed: run
Original: flies --> Stemmed: fli
Original: easily --> Stemmed: easili
Original: fairly --> Stemmed: fair
Original: crying --> Stemmed: cry
Original: happiness --> Stemmed: happi
Original: playing --> Stemmed: play
```

## ‚úÖ **RESULT:**

The **NLTK toolkit** was successfully installed, and stemming was performed using the **PorterStemmer**. The program effectively reduced words to their base or root forms, showcasing a core technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP).



# üí° **Q2 ‚Äì Converting Audio to Text and Text to Audio**


## ‚úÖ **AIM:**

To convert an **audio file into text** and generate an **audio file from text input** using Python libraries like **SpeechRecognition** and **gTTS**.

## üß™ **PROCEDURE:**

1. Use the **SpeechRecognition** library to recognize speech from an audio file.
2. Use **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** to convert text into an audio file.
3. Save and play the generated audio file.
4. Display the converted text from the audio file.


## ‚öôÔ∏è **INSTALLATION:**

Run these commands in your terminal/command prompt:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install gTTS
pip install nltk
```

## üêç **PYTHON PROGRAM:**

```python
import nltk
import os
import speech_recognition as sr
from gtts import gTTS

# Download necessary NLTK resources (used for optional extensions)
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')

# Function to convert audio file to text
def audio_to_text(audio_file):
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.AudioFile(audio_file) as source:
        audio_data = recognizer.record(source)
        text_output = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)
        return text_output

# Function to convert text to audio
def text_to_audio(text, output_file):
    tts = gTTS(text)
    tts.save(output_file)
    os.system(f"start {output_file}")  # Use "start" for Windows, "open" for macOS, "xdg-open" for Linux

# Example Usage:
# Uncomment the below lines if you have a .wav file to convert
# audio_text = audio_to_text("sample.wav")
# print("Converted Audio to Text:", audio_text)

# Convert sample text to audio
sample_text = "Hello, this is a test conversion from text to audio using gTTS and NLTK."
output_audio_file = "output_audio.mp3"
text_to_audio(sample_text, output_audio_file)
print("Text-to-speech conversion saved as 'output_audio.mp3'")
```

## üì§ **OUTPUT:**

```
Text-to-speech conversion saved as 'output_audio.mp3'
```

If you use the `audio_to_text()` function with a valid audio file like `sample.wav`, you'll also see:

```
Converted Audio to Text: <recognized text from the audio file>
```


## ‚úÖ **RESULT:**

Successfully converted an **audio file to text** and generated a **text-to-speech audio file** using Python libraries. This demonstrates **basic speech recognition and speech synthesis** capabilities.

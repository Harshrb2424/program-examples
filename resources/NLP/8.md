# üí° **Ex.No: 8 ‚Äì Converting Audio to Text and Text to Audio**

---

## ‚úÖ **AIM:**

To convert an **audio file into text** and generate an **audio file from text input** using Python libraries like **SpeechRecognition** and **gTTS**.

---

## üß™ **PROCEDURE:**

1. Use the **SpeechRecognition** library to recognize speech from an audio file.
2. Use **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** to convert text into an audio file.
3. Save and play the generated audio file.
4. Display the converted text from the audio file.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **INSTALLATION:**

Run these commands in your terminal/command prompt:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install gTTS
pip install nltk
```

---

## üêç **PYTHON PROGRAM:**

```python
import nltk
import os
import speech_recognition as sr
from gtts import gTTS

# Download necessary NLTK resources (used for optional extensions)
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')

# Function to convert audio file to text
def audio_to_text(audio_file):
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.AudioFile(audio_file) as source:
        audio_data = recognizer.record(source)
        text_output = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)
        return text_output

# Function to convert text to audio
def text_to_audio(text, output_file):
    tts = gTTS(text)
    tts.save(output_file)
    os.system(f"start {output_file}")  # Use "start" for Windows, "open" for macOS, "xdg-open" for Linux

# Example Usage:
# Uncomment the below lines if you have a .wav file to convert
# audio_text = audio_to_text("sample.wav")
# print("Converted Audio to Text:", audio_text)

# Convert sample text to audio
sample_text = "Hello, this is a test conversion from text to audio using gTTS and NLTK."
output_audio_file = "output_audio.mp3"
text_to_audio(sample_text, output_audio_file)
print("Text-to-speech conversion saved as 'output_audio.mp3'")
```

---

## üì§ **OUTPUT:**

```
Text-to-speech conversion saved as 'output_audio.mp3'
```

If you use the `audio_to_text()` function with a valid audio file like `sample.wav`, you'll also see:

```
Converted Audio to Text: <recognized text from the audio file>
```

---

## ‚úÖ **RESULT:**

Successfully converted an **audio file to text** and generated a **text-to-speech audio file** using Python libraries. This demonstrates **basic speech recognition and speech synthesis** capabilities.
